<p>--BACKGROUND--</p>
<p>Linear regression is a simple model oftenly used to predict the value of a CONTINUOUS variable interesting to us. Given a set of data, if there is a inherent structure of them, we may use the "regression" method to degenerate into a line (straight, curve, or more complicated shape, depends on the model you built which should balance between under-fitting and over-fitting). </p>
<p>--MODEL--</p>
<p>$$ y = \sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i \times x_i $$</p>
<p>The above model assumes y is a linear combination of x. If the model fail to fit the data well, you may consider introduce higher order variable which might be like:</p>
<p>$$ y = \sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i \times x_i + \theta_i' \times x_i^2 ... $$</p>
