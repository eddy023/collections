<p>As can be seen, all three operations perform calculations sliding along the "time line". At a particular time instant, it 
generally performs multiple and integration operation to obtain the result for this moment. "Convolution" obtains filtering 
result for this moment, "cross-correlation" evaluates "similarity" between two different series for this moment (intuitively, 
align two series by this time instant and evaluate), "auto-correlation" evaluates "similarity" of a series on its own by 
"aligning" its own value according to this moment. Sliding over the time line, we obtain continueous or discrete results 
(depend on the form of "time-line"). If a series is expressed in matrix, like image, the time-line is in 2d-format, indicating
the row-number and column number respectively.</p>
