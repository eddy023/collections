<p>As can be seen, all three operations perform calculations sliding along the "time line". At a particular time instant, it 
generally performs multiply and integration operations: "Convolution" obtains filtering result for this moment, 
  "cross-correlation" evaluates "similarity" between two different series for this moment (intuitively, 
align two series by this time instant and evaluate), and "auto-correlation" evaluates "similarity" of a series on its own by 
"aligning" its own value according to this moment. Sliding over the time line, we obtain continueous or discrete results 
(depend on the form of "time-line"), e.g., if a series is in the form of matrix, like an image, the time-line will be in 
  discrete 2d-format indicating the row-number and column number respectively.</p>
<p>More on covolution: $$ conv(f,h) = \sum f(t) h(x - t) $$</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic">Fig. 1-2 Two-way to Understand Convluation Calcuation</p>
<p>The first way is easy to understand, convoluation can be treat as a superimposition of function (\(h\)) shifts, which are a
  serie of system responses to a given signal (\(f\)). The second caculates convoluation values point by point, it is 
  straightforward in terms of mathmatical calculation (but hard to give a physical meaning).</p>
