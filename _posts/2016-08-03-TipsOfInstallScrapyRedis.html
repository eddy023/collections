---
<p>If install with pip, no problem found, but the code for a crawler needs to be confined with python2.*.</p>
<p>If install with pip3, there might be a problem with "no such file as openssl/opensslv.h".</p>
<p>In this case, run "sudo apt-get install libssl-dev" to install header file and lib of OpenSSL.</p>
<p>If fail to connect to remote redis server, firstly check in "/etc/redis/redis.conf", change "bind 127.0.0.1" to 
  "bind 0.0.0.0". Then, restart the redis server by "service redis-server restart".</p>
