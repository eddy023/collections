<h3>Chapter 2: Projective Geometry and Transformations of 2D</h3>
<p>Content: homogenous notation, planar geometry, projective transformation</p>
<h4>Section 1</h4>
<p>Terms: planar (2d), collinearity (a straight line is imaged as a straight line)</p>
<p>Planr geometry: geometric viewpoint vs. algebraic viewpoint (coordinates with certen basis) , algebraic approach is helpful for deriving
algorithms and practical computation methods.</p>
<p>Geometric method (e.g., euclid) vs algebraic method (e.g., introduce Descartes coordinates; a conic section is represented by 
  a symmetric matrix). In mathematics, a conic section (or simply conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface 
  of a cone with a plane. The three types of conic section are the hyperbola, the parabola, and the ellipse.  A significant advantage
  of the algebraic approach to geometry is that results derived in this way may more easily be used to derive algo- rithms and 
  practical computational methods. Computation and algorithms are a major concern in this book, which justifies the use of the 
  algebraic method.</p>
<p>Computation: Geometric entities will by default be represented by column vectors.</p>
<p>Homogenous: origins from the equivalent class of vector \((a,b,c)^T\) that represent the same line. The set of equivalence classes 
  of vectors in \(R^3\) âˆ’ \((0, 0, 0)^T\) forms the projective space \(P^2\). The notation \((0, 0, 0)^T\) indicates that the vector 
  \((0, 0, 0)^T\), which does not correspond to any line, is excluded.</p>
<p>[G] If vector V and kV is equivalent in an given circumstance (k is any none zeor scalar), we say V is in homogenous representation
and call it homogenous vector. A 3-vector representing a line is a homogenous vector; A 3-vector representing points in \(R^2\) is 
an homogenous vector; A 4-vector representing points in \(R^3\) is an homogenous vector;</p>
<p>[Ref] Homogeous vector actually represetns a point. A vector has no concept on position but a point does. 
   </br> A vector, note that \([X, Y, Z, o]\) is a matrix:
    $$ v = [v_1, v_2, v_3]^T = v_1X + v_2Y + v_3Z $$
    $$ v = [X, Y, Z, o] \times [v_1, v_2, v_3, 0]^T $$
   </br> A point:
    $$ p - o = [p_1, p_2, p_3] = p_1X + p_2Y + p_3Z $$
    $$ p = [X, Y, Z, o] \times [p_1, p_2, p_3, 1]^T $$
  </br> We can see that the homogenous coordinate for point can represent translation and this is the reason why it is used to dealing with
  computer vision algirthms.
</p> 
<p>Intersection of lines: \(x = l \times l' \)</p>
<p>Line joining points: \(l = x \times x' \)</p>
<p>Cross product: calcuating intersection of lines or line joing points, the coordinates involved in the cross product are all 
  homogenous.</p>
<p>Ideal points and lines at infinite: points in \(R^2\) plus ideal points construct the projective space \(P^2\).
  $$ (1, 0, 0)\dot(x_1, x_2, 0) = 0 $$
</p> Degenerate conic </p>
