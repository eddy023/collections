<h3>Chapter 2: Projective Geometry and Transformations of 2D</h3>
<p>Content: homogenous notation, planar geometry, projective transformation</p>
<h4>Section 1</h4>
<p>Terms: planar (2d), collinearity (a straight line is imaged as a straight line)</p>
<p>Planr geometry: geometric viewpoint vs. algebraic viewpoint (coordinates with certen basis) , algebraic approach is helpful for deriving
algorithms and practical computation methods.</p>
<p>Geometric method (e.g., euclid) vs algebraic method (e.g., introduce Descartes coordinates; a conic section is represented by 
  a symmetric matrix). In mathematics, a conic section (or simply conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface 
  of a cone with a plane. The three types of conic section are the hyperbola, the parabola, and the ellipse.  A significant advantage
  of the algebraic approach to geometry is that results derived in this way may more easily be used to derive algo- rithms and 
  practical computational methods. Computation and algorithms are a major concern in this book, which justifies the use of the 
  algebraic method.</p>
<p>Computation: Geometric entities will by default be represented by column vectors.</p>
<p>Homogenous: origins from the equivalent class of vector \((a,b,c)^T\) that represent the same line. 
<br/> 2D Projective Plane defined by lines: The set of equivalence classes 
  of vectors in \(R^3\) − \((0, 0, 0)^T\) forms the projective space \(P^2\). The notation \((0, 0, 0)^T\) indicates that the vector 
  \((0, 0, 0)^T\), which does not correspond to any line, is excluded.
<br/> 2D Projective Plane defined by points: One may augment \(IR^2\) by adding points with last coordinate x_3 = 0. The resulting 
	space is the set of all homogeneous 3-D vectors, namely the projective space \(IP^2\).
</p>
<p>[G] If vector V and kV is equivalent in an given circumstance (k is any none zeor scalar), we say V is in homogenous representation
and call it homogenous vector. A 3-vector representing a line is a homogenous vector; A 3-vector representing points in \(R^2\) is 
an homogenous vector; A 4-vector representing points in \(R^3\) is an homogenous vector;</p>
<p>[Ref] Homogeous vector actually represetns a point. A vector has no concept on position but a point does. 
   </br> A vector, note that \([X, Y, Z, o]\) is a matrix:
    $$ v = [v_1, v_2, v_3]^T = v_1X + v_2Y + v_3Z $$
    $$ v = [X, Y, Z, o] \times [v_1, v_2, v_3, 0]^T $$
   </br> A point:
    $$ p - o = [p_1, p_2, p_3] = p_1X + p_2Y + p_3Z $$
    $$ p = [X, Y, Z, o] \times [p_1, p_2, p_3, 1]^T $$
  </br> We can see that the homogenous coordinate for point can represent translation and this is the reason why it is used to dealing with
  computer vision algirthms.
</p> 
<p>Intersection of lines: \(x = l \times l' \)</p>
<p>Line joining points: \(l = x \times x' \)</p>
<p>Cross product: calcuating intersection of lines or line joing points, the coordinates involved in the cross product are all 
  homogenous.</p>
<p>Ideal points and lines at infinite: points in \(R^2\) plus ideal points construct the projective space \(P^2\).
  $$ (1, 0, 0)\dot(x_1, x_2, 0) = 0 $$
</p>
<p>Duality Principle: To any theorem of 2-dimensional projective geometry there corresponds a dual theorem, 
	which may be derived by interchanging the roles of points and lines in the original theorem.
</br>we can understand the dulity from the perspective of inner product which shows l \((a, b, c)\) and 
	p \([x, y, z]^T\) are orthgonal.
</p>
<p> Degenerate conic </p>
<p> Conic formual in 2d (X, Y) nomal coordinate:
  $$ aX^2 + bXY + CY^2 + dX + eY + f = 0 $$
  </br> convert into homogenous coordinate (X, Y, Z):
  $$ aX^2 + bXY + CY^2 + dXZ + eYZ + fZ^2 = 0 $$
  </br> It can be again described in matrix form:
  $$ p^TCp = 0 $$
  </br> \(p\) is \([X,Y,Z]^T\) and \(C\) is matrix shown below.
  $$ C = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
	a & b/2 & d/2 \\
	b/2 & c & e/2 \\
	d/2 & e/2 & f \\
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$
</p>
<p> Degenerate conic </p>
<p> A line trangent to a conic at point \(p\): \( l = Cp \)</p>
<p> Dual Conic: \( l^TC^*l = 0 \), \(C^*\) is the adjoint matrix of \(C\) and \(C^* = C^{-1}\)
	</br>Prove (for full rank case): \(l = Cx\) => \(x = C^{-1}l\) => \( (C^{-1}l)^TC(C^{-1}l) = 0\) => \(l^T(C_{-1})^Tl = 0\) => done
        </br> note that \(C\) is symmetric that \((C^{-1})^T = C^{-1}\)
</p>
<p>Degenerate Conic: when \(C\) is not full rank.</p>

<p>Projective Transformations: A projectivity is an invertible mapping h from \(IP^2\) to itself such that three points \(x_1\), 
	\(x_2\) and \(x_3\) lie on the same line if and only if \(h(x_1)\), \(h(x_2)\) and \(h(x_3)\) do.
	</br>
	A projectivity is also called a collineation, a projective transformation or a homography: 
	the terms are synonymous.
        </br> More on "collineation", the key point of projectivity is the maintenance of linearity after transformation, which means 
        "col"-lineation.
