<h3>Chapter 2: Projective Geometry and Transformations of 2D</h3>
<p>Content: homogenous notation, planar geometry, projective transformation</p>
<h4>section 1</h4>
<p>terms: planar (2d), collinearity (a straight line is imaged as a straight line)</p>
<p>planr geometry: geometric viewpoint vs. algebraic viewpoint (coordinates with certen basis) , algebraic approach is helpful for deriving
algorithms and practical computation methods.</p>
<p>computation: Geometric entities will by default be represented by column vectors.</p>
<p>homogenous: origins from the equivalent class of vector \((a,b,c)^T\) that represent the same line. The set of equivalence classes 
  of vectors in \(R^3\) âˆ’ \((0, 0, 0)^T\) forms the projective space \(P^2\). The notation \((0, 0, 0)^T\) indicates that the vector 
  \((0, 0, 0)^T\), which does not correspond to any line, is excluded.</p>
