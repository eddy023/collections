<h3>Chapter 2: Projective Geometry and Transformations of 2D</h3>
<p>Content: homogenous notation, planar geometry, projective transformation</p>
<h4>section 1</h4>
<p>terms: planar (2d), collinearity (a straight line is imaged as a straight line)</p>
<p>planr geometry: geometric viewpoint vs. algebraic viewpoint (coordinates with certen basis) , algebraic approach is helpful for deriving
algorithms and practical computation methods.</p>
