<p>The above figure shows the basic model of machine learning. We can express them using a simply math formula as:</p>
<p><m>$$ y = h(\sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i \times x_i) $$</m></p>
<p><m>$$x$$</m> and <m>$$y$$</m> are the input and output of this model; <m>$$h$$</m> represents "hypothesis". For any known machine learning problem, people follows this model trying to learn a good "hypothesis" or guess to help them predict the future.</p>
