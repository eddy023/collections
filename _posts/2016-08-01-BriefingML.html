<p>The above figure depicts the basic model of machine learning and can be interpreted using a simple math formula:</p>
<p>$$ y = h(\sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i \times x_i) $$</p>
<p>\(x\) and \(y\) are the input and output data of this model, collected beforehand; 
\(h\) represents "hypothesis" and is partially embodied by \(theta\) which are the parameters to learn. 
For any known machine learning problem, people follow this basic model no matter how complicated their specific algorithm is.</p>
<p>The essence of this models lies in two aspects: 1) using given set of \(x\) and \(y\) to discover a coherent relation or 
mapping between them, which is the learning process for \(theta\); 2) using learnt \(theta\) and newly input \(x\) to predict \(y\).</p>
<p> If during the learning process, \(y\) is not given, the algorithm proposed for such problem is called unsupervised learning
, or supervised learning otherwise. Notably, another type of learning algorithm called reinforcement learning gains increasingly 
more attention of the public. Basically, "Reinforcement learning differs from standard supervised learning in that correct input/output 
pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected.", as I quote from wikipedia.</p>
