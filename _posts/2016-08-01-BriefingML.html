<p>I. Introduction</p>
<img src="/collections/imgs/1-ml-model.png" alt="basic ml model" />
<p>The above figure shows the basic model of machine learning. We can express them using a simple math formula as:</p>
<p>$$ y = h(\sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i \times x_i) $$</p>
<p>\(x\) and \(y\) are the input and output data of this model, collected beforehand; \(h\) represents "hypothesis" and is partially embodied by \(theta_i\) which are the parameters to learn. For any known machine learning problem, people follows this basic model no matter how complicated their specific algorithm is.</p>
