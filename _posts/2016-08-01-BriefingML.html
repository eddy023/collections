<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic">Fig. 1-1 A basic model of machine learning algorithm</p>

<p>The above figure depicts the basic model of machine learning and can be interpreted using a simple math formula:</p>
<p>$$ y = h(\sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i \times x_i) $$</p>
<p>\(x\) and \(y\) are the input and output data of the model, collected beforehand or to be prected; 
\(h\) represents "hypothesis" and is partially embodied by \(theta\) which are the parameters to learn. 
For any known machine learning problem, people follow this basic model no matter how complicated their specific algorithm is.</p>
<p>The essence of this models lies in two aspects: 1) using given set of \(x\) and \(y\) to discover a coherent relation or 
mapping between the input and the output, which is the learning process on \(theta\); 2) using learnt \(theta\) and newly input \(x\)
to predict \(y\).</p>
<p> If during the learning process, \(y\) is not provided, the algorithm proposed for such problem is called unsupervised learning
, or supervised learning otherwise. Notably, another type of learning algorithm called reinforcement learning gains increasingly 
more attention of the public. Basically, "Reinforcement learning differs from standard supervised learning in that correct input/output 
pairs are never presented, nor sub-optimal actions explicitly corrected.", as I quote from wikipedia.</p>

<p>We will discuss several supervised and unpervised learning algorithms in this post, but temporarily not dig into reinforcement learning (RL), thus insteand we present a few RL applications below to gain some quick intuitives.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; font-style:italic">1.1 Linear regression</p>
<p>Linear regression is oftenly used to trian a "mapping" to predict the value of a CONTINUOUS variable (e.g., temperature, housing price, visitors, etc). Given a set of data with some inherent linear structure, we try fitting a line into the "sparse data". The data look likes "regressing" into a line which could be straight, curve, or more complicated shape, depends on the model choosed. The gist is to seek balance between under-fitting and over-fitting of data. </p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic">Fig. 2-1 Two examples of linear regression</p>
<p>In Fig. 2-1, the first sub-figure simply follows the model:</p>
<p>$$ y = \sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i \times x_i $$</p>
<p>For the sub-figure in the right, higher order features were introduced:</p>
<p>$$ y = \sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i \times x_i + \theta_i' \times x_i^2 + ... $$</p>
<p>\(n\) represents the number of features, e.g., house area, location, floor, etc. for hourse price prediction. Introducing higher order of them may help improve the prediction accuracy, but as having said, needs to trade between under-fitting and over-fitting</p>
<p>To fit the line to data, we need a criterion on how well the line is fitted and thus we need a cost function:</p>
<p>$$J(\theta) = 1/2 \times \sum_{j=0}^m (\sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i \times x_i^{(j)} - y_j)^2 $$</p>
<p>\(m\) is the number of training data size, that is, the number of (\(x\), \(y\)) pairs.<p>
