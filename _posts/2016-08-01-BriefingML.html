<p>I Introduction</p>
<p>The above figure shows the basic model of machine learning. We can express them using a simply math formula as:</p>
<p><m>$$ y = h(\sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i \times x_i) $$</m></p>
<p><m>$x$</m> and <m>\\(y\\)</m> are the input and output data of this model, collected beforehand; <m>$$h$$</m> represents "hypothesis" and is partially embodied by <m>$$\theta_i$$</m> which are the parameters to learn. For any known machine learning problem, people follows this basic model no matter how complicated their specific algorithm is.</p>
